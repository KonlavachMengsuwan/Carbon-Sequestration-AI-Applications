## 📌 **What is Carbon Sequestration?**
Carbon sequestration is the process of **capturing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂)** to mitigate climate change. It plays a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and balancing the Earth's carbon cycle.

## 🔹 **1. Types of Carbon Sequestration**
### 🌿 **A. Biological Carbon Sequestration**
- **Forests & Trees**: Trees absorb CO₂ during photosynthesis and store it in biomass and soils.
- **Grasslands & Soil Carbon**: Captures carbon in plant roots and stores it in soil organic matter.
- **Wetlands & Peatlands**: Traps carbon in water-saturated soils, preventing its release.
- **Oceans & Marine Ecosystems**: Seagrasses, mangroves, and phytoplankton absorb and store carbon.

### 🏭 **B. Geological Carbon Sequestration**
- **Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)**: Captures CO₂ emissions from power plants and injects them underground.
- **Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)**: Injects CO₂ into depleted oil fields to enhance oil extraction while storing carbon.
- **Mineral Carbonation**: Converts CO₂ into stable carbonates by reacting it with minerals.

### 🏡 **C. Technological & Industrial Carbon Sequestration**
- **Direct Air Capture (DAC)**: Extracts CO₂ directly from the atmosphere using chemical processes.
- **Biochar Production**: Converts biomass into carbon-rich biochar for soil enrichment.
- **Carbon Utilization**: Uses captured CO₂ in manufacturing (e.g., concrete, fuels, plastics).
